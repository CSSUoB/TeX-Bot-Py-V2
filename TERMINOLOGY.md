# TeX-Bot-Py-V2 Terminology

## ["Guild"](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild) Vs ["Server"](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord#Servers)

Confusingly, [Discord](https://discord.com) uses the term ["guild"](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild) to refer to a [Discord "server"](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord#Servers), when communicating with developers.
Therefore, the same terminology (["guild"](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild)) will be used across all documentation in this project.
(See [the Discord developer docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild) & [Pycord's docs](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/api/models.html#discord.Guild) for more information.)

The term "main guild" is used throughout the code in this repository to refer specifically to your community group's main [Discord guild](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild).

## "User" Vs "Member" Vs "Guest"

### [Discord Objects](https://discord.com/developers/docs)

In the context of [Discord](https://discord.com) itself, a ["user"](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user) object represents a [Discord](https://discord.com) account not connected to any specific [guild](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild).
Therefore, it can be [messaged via DM](https://dictionary.com/browse/dm) or be retrieved via its [snowflake ID](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#snowflakes), but little else can be done with it.
(See [the Discord developer docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user) & [Pycord's docs](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/api/models.html#users) for more information.)

In contrast, a [Discord "member" object](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-member-object) is a [user](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user) attached to a specific [guild](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild).
Therefore, it can have [roles](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#role-object), be [banned](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#ban-object) & have many other actions applied to it.
(See [the Discord developer docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-member-object) & [Pycord's docs](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/api/models.html#discord.Member) for more information.)

### Community Group Membership

In the context of your community group's membership structure, a "member" is a person that has purchased a membership to join your community group.
This is in contrast to a "guest", which is a person that has not purchased a membership.
Guests often can only attend events that are open to anyone (i.e. **not** members only), and have limited communication/perks within your [Discord guild](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild).
Some commands may require you to create [roles](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#role-object) within your [Discord guild](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild), to differentiate between these different types of users.

### Other Uses

In some other contexts, the term "user" may be used to refer to any person/organisation making use of this project.
(E.g. the description within [the "Error Codes" section](#error-codes).)
